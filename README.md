# Taylor

Taylor is a non binary, open source Slack App that when installed on a workspace, will DM any user if they use any predefined, non inclusive words. 

I am currently writing this as a fun side project so I can understand Python better and also how to use the Slack Events API and a work in progress.

Let me know your thoughts and feedback as Taylor continues to improve.
